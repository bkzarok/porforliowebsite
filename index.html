      <h2>Hermes Project</h2>
      <div class="project-description">
        <h3>Real Work Project at NICE </h3>
        <p>
            At NICE, I worked on a project called Hermes. The application was an internal tool.
            Hermes is a cloud-based platform that provides a comprehensive solution 
            for managing and utilizing data from multiple sources. 
            NICE specializes in call center software, offering storage for calls,
             video, chat, and email from companies worldwide. The platform allows 
             users to access AWS S3 data and transfer it to another S3 bucket, 
             an SFTP server, an artifactory server, or a physical storage device.
              The application often runs for extended periods, ranging from days 
              to weeks, depending on the data size being transferred. It is 
              designed to be resilient to network failures and other potential 
              issues during the transfer process. The backend consists of four 
              main workers: the Meta Data Retrieval Worker, which retrieves 
              metadata from Elasticsearch or DynamoDB; the Glacier Restore Worker, 
              which restores data from Glacier to S3; the S3 to S3 Transfer Worker, 
              which transfers data between S3 buckets; and the SFTP Worker, 
              which transfers data from S3 to an SFTP server. The frontend was 
              developed using an ASP.NET Core web application, while the backend
               was built with .NET Core. The database used was MS SQL, 
               and the queuing system was based on SQL Server.

      <h2>Black Market SSP Application</h2>
      <div class="project-description">
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>
          This is my application called BlackMarket SSP. This application tracks
          the currency exchange rate of the black market in South Sudan. It also
          tracks the exchange rate of the official bank rate. Additionally, it
          tracks the daily production of all the petroleum operating companies
          in South Sudan. The application is available on the web and on mobile
          platforms, both Android and iOS. The application was developed using
          React Native for the UI, and the backend was developed using Node.js
          and Express.js. The database is Firebase Realtime Database. The
          backend consists of a combination of Firebase functions that
          periodically gather data from relevant sources, and services that
          gather data from multiple sources to accurately estimate the current
          black market rate of the South Sudanese pound against 10 currencies in
          the region around South Sudan and globally. The application also has a
          social element where users can upvote or downvote daily rates and
          comment on rates in their respective areas.
